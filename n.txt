Hi there I am Shiv Shankar from Scratch First Timer. I am going to teach you how t0 develop games. We use scratch to code the game. Let's talk about scratch. Scratch is a block based visual programming language. Which is available as website and as a offline editor where we can code to create games. Users of the site can create projects on the web using a block-like interface. For eg: We create Flappy bird, ping pong game, park the car and race car game etc. Do you think it is hard not at all to learn more go to my youtube channal, my scratch profile and my scratch studio. I am looking for forword to teaching you. scratch first timer out.
